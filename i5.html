                <div class="desc mt-4">Fighting cancer effectively often involves stopping cancer cells from multiplying, which requires understanding proteins that the cells rely on to survive. Protein profiling plays a critical role in this process by helping researchers identify proteins—and their specific parts—that future drugs should target. But when used on their own, past approaches haven’t been detailed enough to spotlight all potential protein targets, leading to some being missed.

                    Now, by combining two methods of protein analysis, a team of chemists at Scripps Research has mapped more than 300 small molecule-reactive cancer proteins, as well as their small molecule binding sites. Revealing key protein targets that, when disrupted with certain chemical compounds (or small molecules), halt cancer cell growth may eventually enable the development of more effective and precise cancer treatments. The findings were published in Nature Chemistry on August 13, 2024.
            </div>
            <div class="desc mt-4">One method gave us a broad view of which proteins were interacting with the chemicals, and the second method showed exactly where those interactions were happening,” says co-senior author Benjamin Cravatt, PhD, the Norton B. Gilula Chair in Biology and Chemistry at Scripps Research.

                Both methods are forms of activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), a technique that Cravatt pioneered to capture protein activity on a global scale. The research team used their dual approach to flag both the proteins and protein sites that interacted with a library of stereoprobes—chemical compounds designed to permanently bind to proteins in a selective manner. Stereoprobes are used to study protein functions and identify possible drug targets.</div>
            <div class="desc mt-4">We've always known that both methods had their drawbacks, but we didn’t know exactly how much information was lost by using just one technique,” says Njomen. “It was surprising to see that a substantial number of protein targets were missed when we used one platform over the other.”

                The team hopes that their findings will one day inform new cancer therapies targeting cell division. In the meantime, Njomen wants to design new stereoprobe libraries to uncover protein pockets implicated in illnesses beyond cancer, including inflammatory disorders.
                
                “Many proteins have been implicated in diseases, but we don't have stereoprobes to research them,” she said. “Moving forward, I’d like to find more protein pockets that we can study for drug discovery purposes.”</div>
